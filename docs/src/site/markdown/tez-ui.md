Tez UI Overview
---------------

The Tez UI relies on the _Application Timeline Server_ whose role is as a
backing store for the application data generated during the lifetime of a
YARN application.

Tez provides its own UI that interfaces with the _Application Timeline Server_
and displays both a live and historical view of the Tez application inside
a Tez UI web application.

Application Timeline Server Setup
---------------------------------

A minimal _yarn-site.xml_ configuration snippet is provided below. Replace
localhost with the actual hostname if running in a distributed setup.

```
yarn-site.xml
-------------
...
<property>
  <description>Indicate to clients whether Timeline service is enabled or not.
  If enabled, the TimelineClient library used by end-users will post entities
  and events to the Timeline server.</description>
  <name>yarn.timeline-service.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>

<property>
  <description>The hostname of the Timeline service web application.</description>
  <name>yarn.timeline-service.hostname</name>
  <value>localhost</value>
</property>

<property>
  <description>Enables cross-origin support (CORS) for web services where
  cross-origin web response headers are needed. For example, javascript making
  a web services request to the timeline server.</description>
  <name>yarn.timeline-service.http-cross-origin.enabled</name>
  <value>true</value>
</property>
...
```

```
# Starting the Application Timeline Server
$ $HADOOP_PREFIX/sbin/yarn-daemon.sh start timelineserver

A minimal _tez-site.xml_ configuration snippet is provided below

```
tez-site.xml
-------------
...
<property>
  <description>Log history using the Application Timeline Server</description>
  <name>tez.history.logging.service.class</name>
  <value>org.apache.tez.dag.history.logging.ats.ATSHistoryLoggingService</value>
</property>

Tez UI is currently under development and is targeted for the 0.6.0 release. A
proof-of-concept Tez UI is available in the Tez UI feature branch TEZ-8.

```
$ git clone git://git.apache.org/tez.git
$ cd tez
$ git checkout TEZ-8

# Navigate you web browser to file:///<tez git directory root>/tez-ui/original/login.html
# Enter hostname to the Application Timeline Server hostname specified in yarn-site.xml
# Enter port to the Application Timeline Server as 8188
```
